# Network-based Combinatorial Drug Repositioning with Differentiated Cells and Subcellular Locations

Current network-based drug repurposing methods utilise vast amounts of interactome data. This interactome data can however be improved through integration of cell-specific protein data and subcellular interaction locations. This project aims to separate protein-protein interactions based on additional data regarding protein expression in differentiated cells and subcellular locations. 

This is a project I am completing for the UNSW Summer Vacation Research Scholarship program.
