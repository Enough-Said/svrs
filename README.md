# Network-Based Combinatorial Drug Repositioning with Protein Contextualisation

Drug repurposing holds vast potential for speeding up clinical outcomes by utilising drugs that are known to have low toxicity. Drugs can also be combined to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity. This project aims to find drug combinations through network-based repurposing utilising human protein-protein interactions, improving on previous attempts by also including contextual protein information such as the expression level of proteins in different cell-types and cell-lines. 

This is a project I am completing for the UNSW Summer Vacation Research Scholarship program.
